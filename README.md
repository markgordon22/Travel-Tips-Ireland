# Design Choices

Hero images were inserted on each page of the website. I considered the profesional opinions of some software developers on hero images for each
page of the website to get their take on the design. Their opinions were that it would be a good design. I found that hero images provided 
great imagery of the beauty that Ireland has to offer. The hero images provides user to the website with a sense of captivation looking at 
the Cliffs of Moher on the home page, Dublin city at night in the about page,the Mourne mountains of County Down in the our tips page and 
the Rock of Cashel in the County Tipperary in the contact page. Consistency in design was important for the website. Every page has a footer,
navbar, hero image and same font-family. [Bootstrapcards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) was used as a tool
to display the holiday destinations for the user.

## Fonts

I imported [Google Fonts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) for the website. I used the font-family [Akaya Telivigala](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Akaya+Telivigala)
due to a personal liking to the font-family and found it as an attractive family for the text and heading content.

## Icons

Icons for the website were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Icons gave an attractive styling for the footer element on each page of the website.
The Icons used included the social media networks for users to contact the site owner. The icons were Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.

## Colours

The body, navbar and footer on each page has a background hex colour of #ffffff with its text and icon content being a hex color of #000000 
to give a nice contrast to the #ffffff background. I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to portray the colour scheme for the website.
