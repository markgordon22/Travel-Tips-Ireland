# Design Choices

Hero images were inserted on each page of the website. I considered the profesional opinions of some software developers on hero images for each
page of the website to get their take on the design. Their opinions were that it would be a good design. I found that hero images provided 
great imagery of the beauty that Ireland has to offer. The hero images provides user to the website with a sense of captivation looking at 
the Cliffs of Moher on the home page, Dublin city at night in the about page,the Mourne mountains of County Down in the our tips page and 
the Rock of Cashel in the County Tipperary in the contact page. Consistency in design was important for the website. Every page has a footer,
navbar, hero image and same font-family. [Bootstrapcards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) was used as a tool
to display the holiday destinations for the user.

## typography

I imported [Google Fonts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) for the website. I used the font-family [Akaya Telivigala](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Akaya+Telivigala)
due to a personal liking to the font-family and found it as an attractive family for the text and heading content.

## Icons

Icons for the website were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Icons gave an attractive styling for the footer element on each page of the website.
The Icons used included the social media networks for users to contact the site owner. The icons were Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.

## Colours

The body, navbar and footer on each page has a background hex colour of #ffffff with its text and icon content being a hex color of #000000 
to give a nice contrast to the #ffffff background. I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to portray the colour scheme for the website.

## Wireframes

Before using any Technologies for wireframing I started off with a pen paper to get a rough feel of what I wanted the website to look and 
feel. I spent roughly 2-3 days doing this. I then used [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to display the finished wireframes for the website.

I made wireframes which I believe equated to good user experiences and expectations. All pages have a simple design and is easy to follow which made
me think that these were suitable platforms for me to sart building the website. Wireframes are linked below. Wireframes
for 2 out of the 4 pages import bootstrap cards as it provided a way of displaying an image with a title followed by text in an easy to follow fashion
for every user. This was a nice and convenient way of advertising the travel destinations.

# Testing

I tested the website over the course of its development. I did this manually by inspecting the look of the website on all devices provided by chrome.
This was a great way to debug the code and pinpointing why the website was not looking at its optimum to provide better user experiences. Family and friends were frequent judges of the 
look and feel of the website to get a taste of users likeability with the website. At the begining of the website I was focused on getting it up and running
on phone and other small devices and working my way up to tablets and desktop.

## Lighthouse testing

Lighthouse was used in Chrome developer tools to measure the performance, seo, accessibility and best practices of the website
The only main issue with the lighthouse testing was the performance score of the Our Tips page.

## Bugs

Over the duration of the development of the website came its bugs. The bugs encountered with its solution is outlined below.

Bug 1. Hero image on the home page had a slight margin to the left of the screen.
Solution: removed Bootstrap container class above the hero image.

Bug 2. Border-top of the footer element along with social media icons on the Our Tips page were positioned to the 
far left of the screen rather than in the middle where it was intended.
Solution: Row class above was missing a closing div element to rap the row

Bug 3. Only myself could fill out the form made by [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/tutorial/creating-contact-form/) and receive an email. I set the default email address to myself in Emailjs.
Solution: Went to my Email Template and set the To Email(in the top right corner of the template) to {{ To }} so that anybody who comes to complete the contact form will receive an email.

Bug 4. When user completes contact form successfully the page did not refresh after the user clicked the ok button below where it says
email was sent successfully.
Solution: I found a line of code on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp) where it reloads the page after user clicks the ok button
when email is sent.

Bug 5. Heroimage on the home page was originally was an image of the Cliffs of Moher during with bright sky which made heading not readable.
Solution: replaced image of the Cliffs of Moher with a less brighter sky so that the title can be easily read by visitors to the site.

Bug 6. Contact page has a beautiful image of the Rock of Cashel which was being blocked by the send message button.
Solution: Increased the size of the hero image so that the user can see the castle entirely.

**Usability Testing**

I Shared the website with friends, family and mentor who broke down a couple of things that could be improved on. It was
mainly the stretching of certain images on the Our Tips page and the lack of responsiveness to the button on the 
home page on a number of smaller devices which ultimately made me decide to remove it from the website. 
Usability was tested on phone, tablet and desktop devices. Lighthouse was used in the assistance of combating these issues.
